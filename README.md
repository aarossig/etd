# etd - Embedded Tower Defense

## Overview

The goal of this project is to implement a tower defense game that uses a
terminal emulator over UART as a user interface.

## Terminal Emulator Support

This has been tested in gnome-terminal using miniterm.py. Minicom attempts to
emulate a VT102 and ignores some non-critical escape sequences.

It has also been tested in Putty on Windows.
